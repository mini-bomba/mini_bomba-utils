# passwordgen
## A simple CLI password generator (in python)

### Requirements

* python3

### Installation

Install the requirements, if not already met.

Clone the repo & add it to the PATH, or download the file, put it in a directory on the PATH (such as /usr/local/bin, or ~/.local/bin) and mark it executable.

### Usage

Run the file from the terminal (by typing `passwordgen`). A random, url-safe string of characters will be generated & displayed in the terminal (automatic copy soonâ„¢?). By default the string will be 64 characters long, but that can be changed by including a number after the command.
