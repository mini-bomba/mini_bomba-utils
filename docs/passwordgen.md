# [passwordgen](/bin/passwordgen)
## A simple CLI password generator (in python)

### Requirements

* python3
* tkinter (optional, for clipboard)
* python-dbus (optional, for clipboard)

### Installation

Install the requirements, if not already met.

Clone the repo & add it to the PATH, or download the file, put it in a directory on the PATH (such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`) and mark it executable.

### Usage

Run the file from the terminal (by typing `passwordgen`). A random, url-safe string of characters will be generated & displayed in the terminal (automatic copy soonâ„¢?). By default the string will be 64 characters long, but that can be changed by including a number after the command.

### Using environment variables to alter program's behaviour

passwordgen accepts advanced parameters through environment variables.
They and their meaning are listed below:

* `MBPASS_MODE`: Specifies where the generated password will be displayed. Possible values:
  * `print`/`terminal`: Default mode. Prints the password on the terminal.
  * `copy`/`clipboard`: Copies the password into the clipboard. May require extra dependencies, see `MBPASS_CLIPBOARD`
  * `both`: Prints the password on the terminal & copies it into the clipboard. May require extra dependencies, see `MBPASS_CLIPBOARD`
* `MBPASS_CLIPBOARD`: Selects the method used to insert the password into your clipboard. Possible values:
  * `tkinter`/`tk` - requires working `tkinter` module. Often the default value.
  * `klipper`/`kde` - requires `python-dbus` module. Default if `XDG_SESSION_DESKTOP` is set to `KDE`
