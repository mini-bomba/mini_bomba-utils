# [ic-hotspot](/bin/ic-hotspot)
## a simple script to automatically authenticate to PKP InterCity's hotspots

### Requirements

* bash
* curl
* grep

### Installation

Install the requirements, if not already met.

Clone the repo & add it to the PATH, or download the file, put it in a directory on the PATH (such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`) and mark it executable.

### Usage
Connect to the WiFi hotspot, run the script, hope it works.

The script should work even when using DNS over TLS (which was my main issue with these captive portals)
