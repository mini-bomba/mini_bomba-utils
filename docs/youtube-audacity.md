# [youtube-audacity](/bin/youtube-audacity)
## A simple script for opening youtube videos in audacity

### Requirements

* bash
* yt-dlp (youtube-dl may still work but yt-dlp is preferred)
* grep
* jq
* xargs
* audacity

### Installation

Install the requirements, if not already met.

Clone the repo & add it to the PATH, or download the file, put it in a directory on the PATH (such as `/usr/local/bin`, or `~/.local/bin`) and mark it executable.

### Usage

This is a clone of [`youtube-music`](./youtube-music.md), edited to open all files in audacity instead of converting them to .mp3s.

See its [documentation file](./youtube-music.md) for more info.
